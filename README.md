a resurrection of the classic natural language comprehension program SHRDLU
extended to allow comprehension of well-defined environments dealing with things other than blocks...

SHRDLU
======
SHRDLU was written in the 1970s. It combined a flexible syntax parser with a semantic engine based on a theorem proving system, which allowed it to understand questions and commands regarding a limited block world.

The [original source code](./shrdlu/code) and [related documentation](./shrdlu/docs/notes.md) can be found in the [shrdlu directory](./shrdlu).
